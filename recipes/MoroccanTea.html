        <em>Maghrebi mint tea (Maghrebi Arabic: أتاي, atay;[1] Arabic: الشاي بالنعناع, romanized: aš-šhāy bin-na'nā';[2] Berber languages: ⴰⵜⴰⵢ, romanized: atay), also known as Moroccan mint tea[3][4] and Algerian mint tea,[5][6][7] is a North African preparation of gunpowder green tea with spearmint leaves and sugar.

            It is traditional to the Greater Maghreb region (the northwest African countries of Morocco, Algeria,[8][9][10] Tunisia, Libya, and Mauritania). Its consumption has spread throughout North Africa, parts of the Sahel, France, Spain, the Arab world, and Middle East.
            
            Mint tea is central to social life in the Maghreb.[11] and is very popular among the Tuareg people of Algeria, Libya, Niger and Mali.[12] The serving can take a ceremonial form, especially when prepared for a guest. The tea is traditionally made by the head male in the family and offered to guests as a sign of hospitality. Typically, at least three glasses of tea are served.[13] The tea is consumed throughout the day as a social activity.[11][14][15] The native spearmint naʿnāʿ (نعناع) possesses a clear, pungent, mild aroma, and is the mint that is traditionally used in Maghrebi mint tea. Other hybrids and cultivars of spearmint, including yerba buena, are occasionally used as substitutes for Nana mint. In Morocco, mint tea is sometimes perfumed with herbs, flowers, or orange blossom water. In the cold season, they add many warming herbs like pennyroyal mint and wormwood.[11] Mint has been used as an infusion, decoction, and herbal medicine throughout the Mediterranean since Antiquity. This aromatic plant was widely used in Algeria to cure and prevent cholera when it plagued the country from 1835 until 1865.[16][17]</em>
