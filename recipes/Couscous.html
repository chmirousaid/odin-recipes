        <em>Couscous (Arabic: كُسْكُس, romanized: kuskus; Berber languages: ⵙⴽⵙⵓ, romanized: seksu) – sometimes called kusksi or kseksu – is a traditional North African dish[5][6] of small[a] steamed granules of rolled semolina[7] that is often served with a stew spooned on top. Pearl millet, sorghum, bulgur, and other cereals are sometimes cooked in a similar way in other regions, and the resulting dishes are also sometimes called couscous.[8][9]: 18 [10]

            Couscous is a staple food throughout the Maghrebi cuisines of Algeria, Tunisia, Mauritania, Morocco, and Libya.[11][12]: 250  It was integrated into French and European cuisine at the beginning of the twentieth century,[13] through the French colonial empire and the Pieds-Noirs of Algeria.[14][15][16]
            
            In 2020, couscous was added to UNESCO's Intangible Cultural Heritage list.[17]</em>
